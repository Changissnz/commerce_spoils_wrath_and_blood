# Commerce, Spoils, Wrath, and Blood

A short story generated by Claude Sonnet 4.6. 

## First, a note by me, Richard Pham 

I try to not acknowledge the fear-mongering going on with this "industrial change", AI. These prolonged years of 
aspiring for fake corporate jobs posted by the state-sponsored surveillance capitalist machine have really 
desensitized me. I view some of the people with their opinions on AI in the same vein that the media portrays 
Jeffrey Epstein, some kind of misunderstood and over-connected monstrosity. 

So the bar keeps getting raised for someone to be able to monetize on their product or to enter the industry to 
access resources and capital. I think I know half the story on this principle. I was briefly a contractor for 
technology companies over in Portland, Oregon. I have no big secrets, nothing to hide, but a few insights to 
share on careerism and capital. For one, there are not supposed to be opportunities for this big "scramble" for 
jobs. This is when the person gets the job, there's all this fuss in the workplace and low salary along with it. 
The workplace, especially in the technology sector, is supposed to be cold metal, from my perspective. If there 
are possible friendships to be made, those take time. But for the most part, there is not supposed to be 
tolerance for culture wars (but America sure loves its defense spending), opinions left and right, games being 
played to provoke, stress, and outrage. What's really peculiar is the way labor agencies are connected. When 
I was working in Oregon, one staffing agency was actually headquartered in Florida. I do not fully understand 
what the F*** is the deal with the organization of labor in the United States. **Corporations use third-party agencies 
to find workers. Potential workers cannot find work. No one wants to do the work. There is too much supply and 
not enough demand.** The excuses and complaints go on and on, and I take a look at where I am in life, not being 
to afford something like a lamborghini or an estate. I would have been feeling sad, but then I remember...I'm not 
Italian or a rich American. However, I do feel entitled to having suitable housing conditions and a salary. Aww... 
I've never had a Bar Mitzvah before. But wait... I'm also not Jewish either. Aww... I've never been to a Chinese New 
Year celebration. But wait... I don't even care that much about Lunar New Year. In fact, when I hear of Oriental 
New Year celebrations, I sometimes think of firebombs and AK-47s. 

Anyhow, this is the United States that I'm talking about. Besides from most Americans knowing at least some English, 
I can't say there are norms that everyone can agree on, without some people really beating it due to their insolent 
self-interest. The issue is that some people think some things are just so funny, until they open up a box 
one day, thinking it's from another nobody that owes them something, them being so entitled and superior... and BOOM!! 
Destruction and disgrace. 

I'm being metaphorical here. Completely and utter. But see how the previous paragraph wasn't really that funny. That's 
how human intimidation and mockery works in the long run past an acceptable level. It's like "sticks and stones can 
break my bones, but words can never hurt me". But then some lowlifer in the government or press gets word of the things 
you allegedly sent and wrote and did. And then you get garbage treatment at work. And then you get fired. And then you 
become CEO one day, have 600 wives like that Arab Solomon, and treat your lieutenants like hog s*** daily because you 
went through so much hardship, so you deserve to feel like a king... and then suddenly... BAM! BAM-BAM BAM! Destruction 
and disgrace.

# Commerce, Spoils, Wrath, and Blood

It is 2026, and the headlines are familiar in the way bad dreams are familiar — not identical to what came before, but cut from the same cloth. The dot-com collapse. The housing implosion. The blockchain fever that consumed 2021 through 2023 in a storm of whitepapers and wallets and solemn declarations that the future had finally, definitively, arrived. Now AI occupies that same headline space with the same intensity, the same investment decks, the same exponential curves projected forward into a future that perpetually recedes. The cycle is not hidden. It is simply ignored, because each iteration arrives wearing different clothes, and human beings are pattern-recognizers who are nonetheless vulnerable to costume.

Many suspect what they are not supposed to say plainly: that the hype is, at least in part, a laundering operation — not necessarily of money, though that too, but of legitimacy. Capital seeks narrative the way water seeks level. When the narrative is technological inevitability, capital flows toward it and brings the populace along as audience, as investor, as believer. The promise is extended. The fine print exists. Nobody reads the fine print. That is the architecture of the arrangement.

Commerce and the state are not opposites. They are rivals in the same business, which is the business of convincing people that the distribution of outcomes is something other than what it is.

Commerce is the more honest liar. It says anyone can win, and this is a statistical truth dressed as a universal invitation. It is a casino that posts the jackpot amounts and buries the odds, and the burying is not incidental — it is the product. Commerce is elitist at the top and populist at the door, and it sustains this contradiction with the confidence of something that requires no one's approval to continue operating. Rules are made by whoever arrived first. Rules are broken by whoever wants to arrive next, or wants to dissolve the current arrangement for a more favorable one. All of this moves under the justification that it is simply how the game works, which is to say, it moves without moral accounting. Games have winners and losers. The only acknowledged sin is losing. Probability shapes individual fates here as much as skill does, and the human brain — unequipped, it turns out, for genuine epistemic humility about its own role in outcomes — builds whatever narrative is necessary to explain the result. Commerce provides the arena. The brain supplies the meaning. Neither is obligated toward accuracy.

The state is a more anxious liar. It requires belief in its own legitimacy in a way that commerce does not, because the state's authority rests on a social contract that commerce never signed. So it performs meritocracy. It hires from institutions of formal recognition, which themselves perform meritocracy, and the circularity of this arrangement is not a flaw — it is the load-bearing structure. A credential becomes evidence of merit because credentialing institutions are presumed to measure merit, and they are presumed to measure merit because they issue credentials. The state needs this to be true. Without it, the apparatus is simply power in a lanyard, managing the distribution of resources and life chances according to the same human appetites that have always governed such things, now with better paperwork.

In practice, neither delivers on its mythology with any consistency. Both are inhabited by people who should not be where they are, doing things that should not be done, having arrived through channels that official accounts do not describe. The career ladder is not a lie exactly — some people climb it — but it is something closer to a selective truth, presented as a general one. The gap between the mythology and the material condition is real, measurable, and carefully managed, because a gap that is acknowledged loses its power to motivate, and motivated people are more useful than cynical ones.

What the information age has delivered, stripped of its promotional framing, is more ambiguous than either its advocates or its critics tend to allow.

The connected information ecosystem restructured the geometry of knowledge, attention, and surveillance simultaneously. It made information ambient. It made monitoring cheap. It made the distance between an individual and global financial markets effectively zero, which sounded like democratization and functioned, in practice, as a new kind of exposure — more people brought into proximity with systems they could observe but not meaningfully influence. The impact on the architecture of civilization is genuine and large. In terms of structural consequence, it sits somewhere in the neighborhood of the atomic bomb, not in the directness of physical damage but in the depth of what it rearranged. How power is projected. How populations are understood by those who govern them. How consent is manufactured and how dissent is dispersed before it can organize.

The marketing promised transformation. What arrived was acceleration — a faster, louder version of what had always been present, which is human beings wanting things, competing for things, harming each other in that competition, and constructing retrospective justifications. The tools changed. The underlying dynamic did not. And in societies where the technology arrived without the institutional infrastructure to absorb it toward productive ends, the result was not progress but the same set of illicit activities — extortion, blackmail, propaganda, distribution networks for controlled substances — running on better software, with cleaner interfaces, at greater scale. These societies are not getting further ahead. They are committing familiar crimes with unfamiliar efficiency.

In those same societies, there are people capable of contributing economically who find, for reasons that resist any single clean explanation, that there is nothing for them to contribute to. The formal economy has contracted, or never expanded to include them, or expanded in ways that demanded credentials they were never offered access to. The corridor narrows. At the end of it are two doors: exclusion or participation in the informal economy, which is a polite term for what is actually available. This is not a moral failure of individuals. It is a structural condition that produces predictable human responses, which are then treated, by those with an interest in treating them this way, as moral failures of individuals.

There is a particular kind of human waste that the word *spoils* captures, though the word is rarely applied this way.

Ordinarily, human spoils refers to people displaced by conflict — populations moved by force, present somewhere because of violence somewhere else. But the spoilage is wider. It describes potential redirected into performance — not the performance of competence, but the performance of status. The energy that might have built something is instead consumed by the maintenance of a position, the deterrence of challenges to that position, the construction of a social architecture in which the position becomes self-defending. The con artist, the institutional impostor, the diva of the organization — these are not simply unpleasant personalities. They are a specific kind of resource misallocation, and they persist not despite the systems they inhabit but because of particular features of those systems that reward the appearance of value over its substance.

Meanwhile, the laborer works. The competent mid-level employee is let go in a restructuring whose logic, when examined, does not hold. The spoiled remain, because they have learned something the earnest have not: that in systems which perform meritocracy without practicing it, proximity to power is more durable than performance. This knowledge, once acquired, is not easily unacquired.

Patience is a resource. Like all resources, it depletes.

For a significant portion of any population, the promised channels of advancement are real enough to prevent immediate despair but not functional enough to deliver on the promise at scale. This is a stable equilibrium, up to a point. The point is not fixed. It moves depending on conditions — economic pressure, the visibility of the gap between what is promised and what is delivered, the availability of alternative explanations for why the gap exists, and the degree to which those explanations successfully redirect grievance away from structural causes and toward other targets.

What accumulates in this system, over time and beneath the surface of normal civic life, is not easily described in the language of political science or economics because it is not yet a political or economic phenomenon. It is something prior to that. It is the slow, structural production of people for whom the contract has visibly failed — not theoretically, not in the abstract, but personally, concretely, in the specific material texture of their lives. They are not necessarily angry in any activated sense. They are waiting, in the way that certain conditions wait — without impatience, without urgency, the way a physical system accumulates stress along a fault line that has not yet moved.

The wrath is not on any feed. It generates no engagement metrics. It is several layers below the visible discourse, below the AI valuations and the bubble warnings and the policy papers and the platform debates. It does not need attention. It is not seeking validation. It is simply present, building toward whatever threshold, whenever that threshold arrives.

This is not Rome. The analogy is too clean, too flattering to everyone involved, too legible.

But the underlying arithmetic has not changed in the intervening centuries. Complexity accumulates. Legitimacy erodes. The gap between what systems promise and what they deliver widens until the energy required to maintain the pretense exceeds what is available. The people who benefit from the pretense are not, as a rule, aware of how close the margin has become. They are insulated by the same machinery that insulates them from most things.

History does not repeat. But certain pressures, when they have nowhere else to go, resolve in ways that have precedent.

For there to be winners, there must be losses. Not just financial losses, not just career losses, but the kind of loss that is made visible and public and permanent — the kind that communicates, to whoever is watching, the cost of having been on the wrong side of the arrangement.

The ticker scrolls. The cycle turns. The hype finds its next vehicle. And beneath all of it, unhurried, the accumulated weight of broken contracts presses quietly against whatever is holding it.

It knows, the way such things know, that it will not be holding forever.
